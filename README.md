# Non-Apology-Generator

This is my first python project, started during the course of study at School for Poetic Computation. Drawing inspiration from famous, infamous, and cliche apology (or non apology) letters, this generator helps all of us express our (in)sincere sorriness for the actions we have done to our loved or unloved ones.
